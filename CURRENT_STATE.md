# Current implementation state

Last updated: 2026-07-13

This file is the durable handoff for continuing the WRF Rust port after context
compaction or a new session. Update it only with verified current-state facts.

## Goal and non-negotiable constraints

- Reimplement WRF in Rust and prove parity by porting and differentially running
  upstream tests.
- Follow `RUST_BACKEND_STYLE_GUIDE.md` as the governing Rust contract.
- Implement CPU kernels first.
- Multithreading is the standard runtime path, not an opt-in feature.
- Keep storage and kernel capability boundaries compatible with a future native
  GPU backend.
- Optimize release-mode compute and memory behavior without sacrificing clear
  ownership, names, and structure. Cheap descriptor/`Arc` clones are acceptable;
  field and domain-state clones in hot paths are not.
- Treat SIMD as a per-kernel CPU implementation layer after scalar parity.

## Upstream reference

- Repository: `https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF`
- Tag: `v4.7.1`
- Commit: `f52c197ed39d12e087d02c50f412d90d418f6186`
- Archive SHA-256:
  `7227916c7871cec36a0a1bf23619fe6d29664474679c8207b4c6f22b10cbab6b`
- Local source: `upstream/WRF` (ignored by the root Git repository)
- Reproducer: `scripts/fetch-wrf.sh`

The GitHub release archive omits WRF's nested submodule contents. Their exact
commits and archive checksums are recorded in `UPSTREAM.toml`, and
`scripts/fetch-wrf.sh` fetches them into `phys/noahmp`, `phys/MYNN-EDMF`, and
`.ci/hpc-workflows`.

## Implemented crates

### `wrf-time`

Implemented:

- proleptic Gregorian dates including year zero and negative years;
- exact rational-second model timestamps and fixed intervals;
- normalized WRF-compatible formatting;
- time/interval addition, subtraction, scaling, and truncating ratios;
- deterministic fixed-step clocks;
- typed errors and component types.

Tests are at the bottom of their implementation files per the style guide. A
previous false expectation for negative fractional interval formatting was
corrected to WRF's `-NN/DD` convention.

### `wrf-compute`

Implemented:

- checked three-dimensional grid shapes;
- contiguous copyable-scalar CPU fields;
- backend-owned field storage boundary;
- narrow `ComputeBackend` allocation trait;
- persistent Rayon CPU thread pool using all available host parallelism by
  default;
- disjoint mutable output chunks with immutable shared inputs;
- typed kernel and worker failures;
- cheap backend clones sharing one `Arc<ThreadPool>`.
- exact contiguous-block scheduling for indivisible grid lines and profiles;
- typed validation of block shapes and worker-panic containment.

Future numerical crates must define narrow kernel capability traits. Do not put
unrelated kernels into `ComputeBackend` and do not expose arbitrary CPU closures
as the GPU API.

### `wrf-dynamics`

Implemented:

- the focused `PositiveDefiniteKernels` backend capability;
- WRF `positive_definite_sheet` for single-precision CPU fields;
- WRF `positive_definite_slab` with typed, validated active ranges;
- in-place correction with no temporary line allocation or copies;
- independent west-east lines scheduled through the persistent Rayon pool;
- scalar ordered minimum/sum reductions for exact parity;
- typed sheet-shape, total-count, and worker failures.

The differential drivers compile the pinned upstream Fortran module directly.
The sheet covers nine exact-bit cases, including signed zero and the epsilon
branch. The slab fixture covers non-one memory origins, domain/tile clipping,
correction branches, and unchanged halo/stagger sentinels. Rust also proves
sheet bitwise determinism between one and four workers.

## Performance decisions

- Release profile: thin LTO, one codegen unit.
- Allocate fields and scratch buffers during setup, not timesteps.
- Prefer contiguous structure-of-arrays field layouts.
- Preserve WRF precision and operation order until parity is established.
- `pulp` is the leading stable-Rust SIMD candidate because it supports runtime
  ISA dispatch. `wide` remains a candidate for controlled build targets.
- `std::simd` is not the stable production baseline while it requires nightly.
- SIMD dispatch happens once per kernel and runs inside CPU worker chunks.

See `docs/architecture/compute_backends.md`,
`docs/architecture/performance_principles.md`, and
`docs/architecture/simd.md`.

## WRF time oracle

The bundled Fortran `external/esmf_time_f90/Test1.F90` is compiled locally
with Homebrew `gfortran` and its output matched `Test1.out.correct` exactly.

Two build details are required:

1. preprocess with `TIME_F90_ONLY` and compile generated `.f` files as free
   form;
2. replace `defaultCalendar=` with the implementation's actual
   `defaultcalkind=` keyword in the generated test copy only.

The second item is an upstream v4.7.1 test/interface mismatch. Never patch the
pinned upstream source to hide it. `scripts/run-wrf-time-oracle.sh` reproduces
the complete sequence without modifying the pinned source.

The upstream golden output contains 89 named `PASS` arithmetic/formatting cases
plus four clock cases, for 93 active cases total. All 93 names now occur in
executing Rust assertions, verified by
`scripts/check-wrf-time-case-coverage.sh`.

## Last verified commands

```text
cargo fmt --all
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
cargo test --workspace --release
./scripts/check-wrf-time-case-coverage.sh
./scripts/run-wrf-time-oracle.sh
./scripts/run-positive-definite-oracle.sh
```

Result: 38 unit tests and one doctest passed in debug and release modes (11
`wrf-compute`, 7 `wrf-dynamics`, 20 `wrf-time`), Clippy and rustdoc are clean,
93/93 active WRF time cases are referenced by executing Rust assertions, both
Fortran time interfaces match `Test1.out.correct`, all nine sheet oracle cases
match raw IEEE-754 bits, and the slab boundary/halo fixture matches exactly.

## Maintained knowledge and quality ledgers

- `docs/wiki/README.md`: technical encyclopedia and onboarding index.
- `TEST_COVERAGE.md`: upstream, adversarial, concurrency, and operational gaps.
- `UPSTREAM_FINDINGS.md`: reproducible Fortran bugs, test gaps, and performance
  opportunities with confidence labels.
- Public crates enable missing-doc warnings and deny broken rustdoc links.

## Immediate next actions

1. Add a representative release benchmark and allocation/scaling evidence for
   the positive-definite kernels before considering explicit `pulp` SIMD.
2. Select the next dependency-closed ARW numerical kernel using the same
   Fortran-oracle, adversarial-test, wiki, rustdoc, and findings workflow.
