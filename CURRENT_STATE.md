# Current implementation state

Last updated: 2026-07-13

This file is the durable handoff for continuing the WRF Rust port after context
compaction or a new session. Update it only with verified current-state facts.

## Goal and non-negotiable constraints

- Reimplement WRF in Rust and prove parity by porting and differentially running
  upstream tests.
- Follow `RUST_BACKEND_STYLE_GUIDE.md` as the governing Rust contract.
- Implement CPU kernels first.
- Multithreading is the standard runtime path, not an opt-in feature.
- Keep storage and kernel capability boundaries compatible with a future native
  GPU backend.
- Optimize release-mode compute and memory behavior without sacrificing clear
  ownership, names, and structure. Cheap descriptor/`Arc` clones are acceptable;
  field and domain-state clones in hot paths are not.
- Treat SIMD as a per-kernel CPU implementation layer after scalar parity.
- Group source by scientific family with nested modules; keep crate roots as
  stable public facades rather than flat implementation indexes.
- Benchmark the exact pinned Fortran routine on a matched workload for every
  numerical kernel and track honest Rust/Fortran ratios.

commits and archive checksums are recorded in `UPSTREAM.toml`, and
`scripts/fetch-wrf.sh` fetches them into `phys/noahmp`, `phys/MYNN-EDMF`, and
`.ci/hpc-workflows`.

## Implemented crates

### `wrf-time`

Implemented:

- proleptic Gregorian dates including year zero and negative years;
- exact rational-second model timestamps and fixed intervals;
- normalized WRF-compatible formatting;
- time/interval addition, subtraction, scaling, and truncating ratios;
- deterministic fixed-step clocks;
- typed errors and component types.

Tests are at the bottom of their implementation files per the style guide. A
previous false expectation for negative fractional interval formatting was
corrected to WRF's `-NN/DD` convention.

### `wrf-compute`

Implemented:

- checked three-dimensional grid shapes;
- contiguous copyable-scalar CPU fields;
- backend-owned field storage boundary;
- narrow `ComputeBackend` allocation trait;
- persistent Rayon CPU thread pool using all available host parallelism by
  default;
- disjoint mutable output chunks with immutable shared inputs;
- typed kernel and worker failures;
- cheap backend clones sharing one `Arc<ThreadPool>`.
- exact contiguous-block scheduling for indivisible grid lines and profiles;
- typed validation of block shapes and worker-panic containment.

Future numerical crates must define narrow kernel capability traits. Do not put
unrelated kernels into `ComputeBackend` and do not expose arbitrary CPU closures
as the GPU API.

### `wrf-dynamics`

Implemented:

- the focused `PositiveDefiniteKernels` backend capability;
- WRF `positive_definite_sheet` for single-precision CPU fields;
- WRF `positive_definite_slab` with typed, validated active ranges;
- in-place correction with no temporary line allocation or copies;
- independent west-east lines scheduled through the persistent Rayon pool;
- scalar ordered minimum/sum reductions for exact parity;
- typed sheet-shape, total-count, and worker failures.
- the focused `HeldSuarezDampingKernels` backend capability;
- WRF `held_suarez_damp` over six borrowed fields with no field clones;
- typed validation of shapes, ranges, the pressure reference level, and both
  C-grid staggered predecessors;
- exact-bit tendency updates over independently scheduled west-east lines;
- scientific-family directories for `positive_definite` and `held_suarez`,
  with `lib.rs` retained as the stable public facade.

The differential drivers compile the pinned upstream Fortran module directly.
The sheet covers nine exact-bit cases, including signed zero and the epsilon
branch. The slab fixture covers non-one memory origins, domain/tile clipping,
correction branches, and unchanged halo/stagger sentinels. Rust also proves
sheet bitwise determinism between one and four workers.

The Held-Suarez differential fixture checks 16 active and boundary values with
non-one memory origins. Added Rust tests cover one/four-worker determinism,
shape failure before mutation, all range categories, staggered predecessors,
and the pressure reference level.

## Performance decisions

- Release profile: thin LTO, one codegen unit.
- Allocate fields and scratch buffers during setup, not timesteps.
- Prefer contiguous structure-of-arrays field layouts.
- Preserve WRF precision and operation order until parity is established.
- `pulp` is the leading stable-Rust SIMD candidate because it supports runtime
  ISA dispatch. `wide` remains a candidate for controlled build targets.
- `std::simd` is not the stable production baseline while it requires nightly.
- SIMD dispatch happens once per kernel and runs inside CPU worker chunks.
- Criterion 0.7 is a dev-only statistical benchmark dependency; 0.8 is excluded
  because it exceeds the workspace's declared Rust 1.85 minimum.

See `docs/architecture/compute_backends.md`,
`docs/architecture/performance_principles.md`, and
`docs/architecture/simd.md`.

## Positive-definite performance baseline

The 1,048,576-value Criterion baseline on an Apple M3 Max measured:

- sheet: 1.1569 ms (1 worker), 316.00 µs (4), 274.85 µs (16);
- slab: 1.8084 ms (1 worker), 483.08 µs (4), 347.98 µs (16).

Four workers capture most sheet scaling; 16 workers reach 4.21× sheet and 5.20×
slab speedup over one. AArch64 release assembly contains scalar rather than
packed NEON arithmetic in the pointwise loops. See
`docs/performance/positive-definite-2026-07-13.md` for environment, confidence
intervals, throughput, and caveats. End-to-end steady-state allocation
measurement shows one or two 1,520-byte Rayon/crossbeam queue allocations per
100 dispatches, independent of worker count, and no reallocations. Do not claim
zero Rayon-dispatch allocations; the precise measured amortized cost is
0.01–0.02 allocations and 15.2–30.4 bytes per million-point call.

`pulp` 0.22.3 was then prototyped for only the pointwise passes. It preserved
exact bits across 14 vector/tail lengths and the upstream fixtures, but slowed
the one- and four-worker benchmarks by about 1–4%. Gains appeared only at 16
workers. The implementation and dependency were removed; keep the scalar path
for this kernel. `pulp` remains a candidate for more pointwise-dominant kernels.

## Held-Suarez performance baseline

For 2,097,152 momentum updates on the Apple M3 Max, Criterion measured 0.97808
ms with one Rust worker, 0.30533 ms with four, and 0.55094 ms with 16. A matched
GNU Fortran 14.2.0 `-O3 -flto` run of the pinned routine measured a 0.859712 ms
median across seven samples. Current Rust is 13.8% slower serially and 2.82×
faster with four workers than serial Fortran. This is an isolated-kernel result,
not a whole-model claim. See `PERFORMANCE_PARITY.md` and
`docs/performance/held-suarez-2026-07-13.md`.

## WRF time oracle

The bundled Fortran `external/esmf_time_f90/Test1.F90` is compiled locally
with Homebrew `gfortran` and its output matched `Test1.out.correct` exactly.

Two build details are required:

1. preprocess with `TIME_F90_ONLY` and compile generated `.f` files as free
   form;
2. replace `defaultCalendar=` with the implementation's actual
   `defaultcalkind=` keyword in the generated test copy only.

The second item is an upstream v4.7.1 test/interface mismatch. Never patch the
pinned upstream source to hide it. `scripts/run-wrf-time-oracle.sh` reproduces
the complete sequence without modifying the pinned source.

The upstream golden output contains 89 named `PASS` arithmetic/formatting cases
plus four clock cases, for 93 active cases total. All 93 names now occur in
executing Rust assertions, verified by
`scripts/check-wrf-time-case-coverage.sh`.

## Last verified commands

```text
cargo fmt --all
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
cargo test --workspace --release
./scripts/check-wrf-time-case-coverage.sh
./scripts/run-wrf-time-oracle.sh
./scripts/run-positive-definite-oracle.sh
./scripts/run-held-suarez-oracle.sh
./scripts/benchmark-held-suarez-fortran.sh
```

Result: 44 unit tests and one doctest passed in debug and release modes (11
`wrf-compute`, 13 `wrf-dynamics`, 20 `wrf-time`), including all-target benchmark
smoke execution. Clippy and rustdoc are clean. The release gate exposed and
fixed a scheduler-test assumption that a small workload would necessarily be
stolen by multiple workers; the test now coordinates overlapping tasks before
asserting concurrency. All 93 active WRF time cases are referenced by executing
Rust assertions, both Fortran time interfaces match `Test1.out.correct`, both
positive-definite oracles match raw IEEE-754 bits, and the 16-selection
Held-Suarez boundary oracle matches exactly.

## Maintained knowledge and quality ledgers

- `docs/wiki/README.md`: technical encyclopedia and onboarding index.
- `TEST_COVERAGE.md`: upstream, adversarial, concurrency, and operational gaps.
- `UPSTREAM_FINDINGS.md`: reproducible Fortran bugs, test gaps, and performance
  opportunities with confidence labels.
- `PERFORMANCE_PARITY.md`: matched Rust/Fortran workload policy and cumulative
  speed ratios.
- Public crates enable missing-doc warnings and deny broken rustdoc links.

## Git checkpoints

- `bb6cc55` — pinned source tooling, time parity, compute architecture, both
  positive-definite kernels, wiki, coverage ledger, and upstream findings.
- `0ee002d` — Criterion throughput/scaling harness and scalar baseline.
- `7389443` — instrumented steady-state allocation budgets and measurements.
- `5b5f7aa` — documented and removed a parity-correct SIMD prototype that
  regressed representative positive-definite benchmarks.

## Immediate next actions

1. Close the Held-Suarez serial performance gap only if a safe optimization
   preserves exact-bit parity and wins representative benchmarks.
2. Backfill matched Fortran baselines for both positive-definite variants.
3. Select the next dependency-closed ARW numerical kernel using the same
   oracle, adversarial-test, wiki, rustdoc, findings, and performance workflow.
